                <h5>How Music Affect Everyone</h5>
                <p>Evolutionary scientists say human beings may have developed a dependence on music as a communication tool because our ancestors descended from arboreal species â€” tree-dwellers who called to one another across the canopy.
                    Music memory is one of the brain functions most resistant to dementia. That is why some caregivers have had success using music to calm dementia patients and build trusting connections with them.Music literally changes the brain.
                    Neurological researchers have found that listening to music triggers the release of several neurochemicals that play a role in brain function and mental health. Music exerts a powerful influence on human beings. It can boost memory,
                    build task endurance, lighten your mood, reduce anxiety and depression, stave off fatigue, improve your response to pain, and help you work out more effectively.</p>
